<p align="center">

</p>
This repository contains a custom approach for retinal vessel segmentation on the DRIVE dataset. The project utilizes various advanced computer vision techniques, such as mathematical morphology, image enhancement, and segmentation algorithms to accurately identify and segment blood vessels in retinal images. This is crucial for the early diagnosis and treatment of various eye-related diseases like diabetic retinopathy.

### Main Methods Used:

1. **Mathematical Morphology:** Utilized morphological operations such as erosion and dilation to enhance the retinal images and remove noise.

2. **Image Enhancement:** Applied techniques like contrast adjustment, histogram equalization, and adaptive thresholding to improve the visibility of retinal vessels.

3. **Segmentation Algorithms:** Developed a custom algorithm to segment the retinal vessels from the background, using techniques such as edge detection, region growing, and watershed segmentation.
